# Project Memory

This document serves as a long-term memory for our project, capturing major decisions, implementations, and learnings.

## Project Initialization (May 21, 2025)
- Started with SvelteKit boilerplate
- Created project plan with three main phases:
  1. Foundation (Portfolio, Courses, Authentication)
  2. Advanced Features (Course delivery, Payment processing)
  3. Community Features (Chat, Forums)
- Selected technology stack:
  - SvelteKit for full-stack framework
  - Svelte Flow for interactive diagrams
  - shadcn/svelte for UI components
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - Prisma for database ORM
  - Lucia for authentication

## Major Architectural Decisions
- Using SvelteKit for both frontend and backend
- Filesystem-based routing structure
- Component-driven UI approach with shadcn/svelte
- Authentication with Lucia Auth
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- Real-time features using Socket.io (planned)

## Key Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Integrating Multiple Svelte Libraries
*Planned solution:* Create a consistent theming system that works across all libraries using Tailwind CSS as the foundation.

### Challenge 2: Building Responsive, High-Performance UI
*Planned solution:* Use code-splitting, lazy loading, and optimized assets to ensure fast performance while maintaining rich UI.

### Challenge 3: Implementing Real-time Features
*Planned solution:* Use Socket.io for real-time communication, with proper connection management and fallback mechanisms.

## Deployment Strategy
- Development: Local environment
- Staging: Vercel/Netlify preview environments
- Production: Vercel/Netlify/Digital Ocean

## Team Roles and Responsibilities
- Developer: Implementation of all features
- Designer: UI/UX design (potentially external)
- Content Creator: Course content (client responsibility)

## Future Roadmap
- Mobile application
- AI-powered workout recommendations
- Video streaming for live classes
- Nutrition planning integration
